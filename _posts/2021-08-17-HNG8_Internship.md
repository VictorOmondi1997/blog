# My Goals for this internship
Through this internship, I will be on the **Backend Track**, the backend consist of industry most popular languages allowing one to explore various options such as NodeJs, PHP, Go or python and makes it easier for one to get your dream job. The following are my goals and what I'd like to achieve by the end of 8 weeks:
1. **To upskill myself in backend development**: I am an intermediate python developer skilled in data science technologies, through this internship I'd like to upskill my self more in python for backend development.
2. **To collaborate with other peers in a real world problem**: Through open source technologies, I would like to collaborate with other interns to come up with a solution that solves a problem.
3. **To be mentored by industry experts**: Through this internship I would like to be mentored and gain experience from other industry experts who are well versed in backend development and also soft skills. I would also like to gain aspects of leadership and mentorship so as to be a better mentor in futer HNG internships or other tech communities.
4. **To share my knowldge and skills**: I am already experienced in software development and I would like to guide other interns effectively, assist them while they are facing challenges during the internship and mentor them during the internship

# Tutorials
Before I depart, below are some of the awesome tutorial I'd love to share:
1. **Figma**: [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) is a vector graphics editor and prototyping tool which is primarily web-based, with additional offline features enabled by desktop applications for macOS and Windows. Figma connects everyone in the design process so teams can deliver better products, faster. The official [Figma youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQsVmhSa4X-G3lHlUtejzLA) has great tutorials on getting started with figma. Check the tutorial in the [New to Figma? Get started with "Figma for beginners" t](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx2dkpBxst8&list=PLXDU_eVOJTx7QHLShNqIXL1Cgbxj7HlN4)
2. **Git**: [Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. From the official git documentation, you can get the entire Pro git book for free, written by Scott Chacon and Ben Straub and published by Apress, is available [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2).
3. **HTML**: HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It is the standard markup language for creating Web pages. W3 schools has great tutorial on [Introduction to HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp)
4. **Python**: for this internship, I'll be focusing on using python as my primary language for backend development. Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming. Pythonâ€™s elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms.For [introduction to python tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/), I like using the official documentation
