Hi! I'm Victor Omondi, Student Ambassador at [Agora.io](https://agora.io), and a Bachelor of Scince (Computer Technology) student at [Multimedia University of Kenya](https://www.multimedia university of Kenya). I like manipulating, exploring, visualizing and modeling data to obtain insights that can be used in future decision making.


This blog is built with [fastpages](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages), An easy to use blogging platform with extra features for Jupyter Notebooks.
